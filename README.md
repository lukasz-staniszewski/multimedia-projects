1. Signals
    + Task 1 - Determining the amplitude and phase spectrum, calculating the signal power and check the Parseval theorem. Checking the validity of the discrete Fourier transform theorem of circular convolution of signals.
    + Task 2 - Investigating the effect of time shift on the form of the amplitude spectrum and phase spectrum of a discrete harmonic signal.
    + Task 3 - Investigating the effect of zero padding on the form of the amplitude spectrum and phase spectrum of a discrete signal.
    + Task 4 - Plotting the power spectral density graph of the real signal assuming a specific number of samples. Determining whether spectral leakage occurs for a given number of samples.
